# FlatLand

In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation. So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. He starts with N Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles. He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side S requires S2 Circles to create.

Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.

## Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single integer N.
## Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of squares.

## Constraints
1≤T≤1000

1≤N≤1000
## Sample Input:
2

85

114

## Sample Output:
2

4

## EXPLANATION:
Test case 1 : Mr Sphere forms a square of side 9 using 81 Circles and then forms a square of side 2 using the remaining 4.
