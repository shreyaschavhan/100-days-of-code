# Hostel Management System

---
> Description:
The Objective of this mini project is to implement an electronic hostel management system that will streamline registration process, reduce administrative tasks and paper work so as to improve the registration cycle process flow.
P.S. The main aim of this Mini Project was to understand and understand the basic concepts DSA [Data Structure and algorithm].

## Introduction

The usual practices in accommodating students involve students going to the students affairs office to fill out a form for registration. Thereafter, students are registered for the new session by providing a bank teller/receipt of payment and a new hostel accommodation would be allocated to the student. After registration, students profiles are transferred to the porter's lodge where students will receive a mattress, pillow, and so on. Unfortunately, these processes are carried out manually with pen and papers; an unreliable procedure which is associated with inefficiencies.

The Objective of this mini project is to implement an electronic hostel management system that will streamline registration process, reduce administrative tasks and paper work so as to improve the registration cycle process flow.
