## Input:
The first line contains 7 space-separated integers a1, a2, …, a7.

The first line contains 7 space-separated integers f1, f2, …, f7.
## Output:
Print a single integer denoting the answer.

## Constraints
-100 <= ti, fi <= 100
## Sample Input:
14 13 12 13 16 18 21

15 11 12 11 16 19 24
