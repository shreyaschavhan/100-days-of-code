In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages .

Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N whose square root needs to be computed.

## Output

For each line of the input, output the square root of the input integer, rounded down to the nearest integer, in a new line.

## Constraints

1<=T<=20

1<=N<=10000

## Input:

3

10

5

10000

## Output:

3

2

100
