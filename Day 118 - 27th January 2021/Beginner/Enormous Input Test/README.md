The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

## Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

## Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

## Example

Input:

7 3

1

51

966369

7

9

999996

11


Output:

4
