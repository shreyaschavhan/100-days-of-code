Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class
b) Highest score and lowest score of class
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency

-----------------------------------------------------

Assignment 2:

a) Addition of two matrices
b) Subtraction of two matrices
c) Multiplication of two matrices
d) Transpose of a matrix

-----------------------------------------------------

Assignment 3:
Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write
function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
a) Selection Sort
b) Bubble sort and display top five scores.

-----------------------------------------------------

Assignment 4:

Assignment 5:
Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students
of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request.
Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of
club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club
member‘s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write
functions to:
a) Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b) Compute total number of members of club
c) Display members
d) Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.

Assignment 6:
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use
priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++
program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete job from queue.

-----------------------------------------------------

Assignment 7:
A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be
made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one-
dimensional array. Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and
delete elements from either end of the deque.

Assignment 8:
Pizza parlor accepting maximum M orders. Orders are served in first come first served
basis. Order once placed cannot be cancelled. Write C++ program to simulate the system
using circular queue using array.
